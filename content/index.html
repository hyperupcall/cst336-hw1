<h1>Linux</h1>
<p>
	<dfn id="linux">Linux</dfn> is an <mark>important</mark> piece of software that
	underpins modern society. It is a piece of software, called a &ldquo;kernel&rdquo;.
	Linux runs on many different types of hardware, such as those found in consumer laptops
	and smartphones. It is also used other consumer products and manufacturing environments.
	Similar to the macOS kernel (XNU) and the Windows kernel (Windows NT), Linux runs
	familiar applications such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Zoom, VLC Media Player and
	Blender.

	There are several reasons why people may choose <a href="#linux">Linux</a> over MacOS or
	Windows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is free</li>
	<li>It takes up less storage</li>
	<li>It consumes less memory</li>
	<li>It is often faster</li>
</ul>

	<summary>Why is Linux faster than other operatinng systems?</summary>

	In the case of the MacOS and Windows operating systems, the direction of development is
	controlled by Apple and Microsoft, respectively. Apple and Microsoft are large public
	companies that have <i>repeatedly</i> demonstrated that they care about profits more
	than anything else. For example, if top-level executives want to prioritize features
	(say, AI) developer resources will necessarily be allocated to that, reducing the amount
	of people that work on bug fixing or performance. Linux is different. While large
	for-profit companies do contribute to the kernel, the maintainers that review the code
	have a strong incentive to only merge readable and fast code. There are several reasons
	why this explanation is poorly written, but I'm not going to rewrite it.

<blockquote>
	<p>Hello everybody out there using minix -</p>
	<p>
		I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like
		gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get
		ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix; as my OS
		resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-sytem due to practical
		reasons) among other things.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) an gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies
		that i’ll get something practical within a few months, and I’d like to know what
		features most people want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll
		implement them :-)
	</p>
	<p>
		PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT
		[portable] (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything
		other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

	Linux was initially a hobby project developed by a single person. At first, a few
	interested developers began contributing feature and fixing bugs. Gradually, more and
	more developers took interest in the project, adding more and more code. This positive
	feedback loop eventually spiraled to the situation that we have today - a world where
	thousands of developers (many working full-time for large corporations) contribute every
	year to contribute to the Linux kernel.
