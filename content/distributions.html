<h1>Distributions</h1>

<p>
	Linux is just a kernel. It is software that creates an environment for other programs to
	make computations and interact with software. If only Linux were installed on a personal
	computer, developers wouldn't be able to do much. It would be like giving a graphic
	designer a computer without any graphics processing software, or giving a music producer
	a computer without any music producing applications. Unlike graphic designers and music
	producers, developers need a set of command-line utilities that allow them to understand
	what Linux is doing and create scripts for automating tasks.
</p>

<h2>Basic Command-line Utilities</h2>

<p>
	One project that contains many of these command-line utilities is GNU Core Utilities. It
	implements many familier command-line utilities, like <code>mv</code>, <code>ls</code>,
	<code>rm</code>, and <code>mkdir</code>. These command-line tools are used to create,
	modify, and delete files, modify how data is formatted, and provide
	&ldquo;functions&rdquo; for use in shell scripts.
</p>

<p>
	GNU Core Utilities provides half of the picture. But there needs to be tools that show
	information about Linux or that use Linux to perform basic hardware tasks. That's where
	<a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/">util-linux</a> comes into
	play. It provides utilities such as <code>mkfs</code>, <code>blkid</code>, and
	<code>dmesg</code> that allow users to format disks, list disk information, and show the
	kernel ring buffer. Another popular project,
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> provides utilities for manaing
	processes, such as <code>ps</code>, <code>pkill</code>, and <code>top</code>, among
	other functionality.
</p>

<h2>Linux Distributors</h2>

<p>
	It is the job of developers of Linux distributions to find and incorporate these
	utilities with Linux in a way that is usable by the end consumer. Linux distribution
	usually also include:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>A graphical environment</li>
	<li>A package manager, to install and uninstall software</li>
	<li>
		Necessary GUI apps that include a file manager, settings app, system monitor, software
		updators, video players, and more
	</li>
	<li>
		Popular applications like Mozilla Firefox, LibreOffice,, pre-installed for convenience
	</li>
	<li>
		A file, known as a disk image or ISO, that is written to a USB Drive to make the
		installation easier
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>Popular Linux Distributions</h2>

<p>
	The most popular Linux distribution is <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, which
	is managed by the company <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>. There are
	multiple versions of Ubuntu:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ubuntu Desktop</li>
	<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
	<li>Ubuntu Cloud</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Each version of Ubuntu is optimized for its use. For example, Ubuntu Desktop is the only
	one to include graphical software out of the box; neither Ubuntu Server nor Ubuntu Cloud
	do so. And, with Ubuntu Cloud, it does not build device drivers into the Linux kernel
	that are not used in a cloud environment, such as drivers for physical keyboards.
</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other Linux distributions; some include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Slackware</li>
	<li>Debian</li>
	<li>Pop! OS</li>
	<li>Fedora</li>
	<li>Arch Linux</li>
	<li>Gentoo</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that is currently maintained. It is less
	frequently updated and rarely used by developers. Debian is also one of the oldest
	distributions. It has a less frequent update cadence as well, but it is one of the, if
	not the, most widely used Linux distribution. People choose it because it is stable and
	minimal. Pop! OS is similar to Ubuntu, but adds several features that simplify
	installation for consumers. The graphical installer is easier to navigate, and it makes
	it easier to install Linux to computers with NVIDIA GPUs (this is less of an issue now).
	Fedora is also widely used; it is known for being ahead of the pack in incorporating new
	technologies, whether that is systemd as a PID 1 process, PipeWire for audio handling,
	or Wayland as a display manager. Sometimes the frequent releases and early changes to
	new software introduce bugs. Lastly, Arch Linux and Gentoo are more minimal Linux
	distributions that are geared towards advanced users that have free time.
