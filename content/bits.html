<h1>Miscellaneous Bits</h1>

<p>I wanted to note a few interesting things that didn't exactly fit into other categories.</p>

<h2>Floating Point Instructions</h2>
<p>
	When writing C in a hosted environment (not freestanding), programmers rarely need to
	think about whether certain CPU instructions should be restricted or forbidden entirely.
	In kernels like Linux, programmers may need to think carefully, weighing performance,
	developer experience, and other considerations.
</p>
<p>
	According to the
	<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/floating-point.html">Linux Documentation</a>
	<blockquote>
		Kernel code is normally prohibited from using floating-point (FP) registers or
		instructions, including the C float and double data types. This rule reduces system call
		overhead, because the kernel does not need to save and restore the userspace
		floating-point register state.
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Of course, this makes sense. Let's say that a program context includes instructions that call a syscall: execution will move from a more priviledged protection ring level 3 to level 0. Kernel code will execute, storing and retrieving data using the registers made available by the ISA. When execution returns back to userspace, the registers must be &ldquo;reset&rdquo; to their original values. This is fundamental as a programming context must continue to work as if exeuction did not pause. Even if the instructions of a program do not use floating point digits, Linux still must &ldquo;reset&rdquo; them to some default value. Otherwise, the kernel will leak information to userspace, which is a security issue.</p>

<h2>kexec</h2>

<p>Typically to boot into an operating system, a user must &ldquot;restart&rdquote; their computer. Linux allows a user to boot from one Linux kernel into another Linux kernel using functionality called kexec. This significantly improves the time it takes to boot because hardware initialization (performed by the BIOS) is skipped.</p>

<p>kexec performs two high-level steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Loads new kernel in memory</li>
	<li>Reboots into the loaded kernel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementations of Data Structures</h2>

<p>
	Like any larger standalone C program, the Linux kernel implements many commonly used data structures.

	<h2>Applications of Linux</h2>

	<h3>Pump it Up</h3>

	<p>Pump it up is a dancing game created by Andamiro. The game software runs on a kernel, which turn reads hardware input from the foodpads, processes it, and transmits video to a monitor. It may run Linux, it may not... who knows.</p>

	<p>Recently, I've been absolutely addicted to the machine. I love dancing to K-Pop and fast-paced, high-bass EDM songs.</p>

	<h3>Corolla AE86</h3>

	<p>It is becoming <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/new-standard-red-hat-vehicle-operating-system-modern-and-future-vehicles">more common</a> for automobile manufacturers to use Linux in automobiles. The Corolla AE86 is an example where this is not the case. It was manufactured decades ago.</p>

	<p>I'm not realy a car person, but I <em>really</em> like the boxy shape of older cars. I especially like the AE86. The pop-up headlights are so cute and fun!</p>
