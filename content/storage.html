<h1>Linux Storage Stack</h1>
<p>In computation, it is often useful to store data for later. Sometimes that &ldquot;later&rdquot; is in a few hundred instruction cycles. Other times, it may mean in a few months. Longer-lived data, more specifically, data that is usually stored in non-volatile storage, needs to be accessed and retrieved. Linux handles that access and retrieval through its <a href="/README.md">https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/index.html</a></p>
